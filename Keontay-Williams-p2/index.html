        <h3> Absolver is a fighting game that released back in August of 2017. The game is jam packed with martial arts mixed with fantasy powers and many variants of clothing you can purchase and/or loot to make your character stand out from the others. You can either play solo, coop, or PvP where you challenge other players in matches that're called trials.</h3>
        
        <h4> Noita is a magic based rogue-like dungeon crawler where every pixel is simulated, meaning you can destroy just about anything and see the debris rolling, flying, colliding, and evaporating real time. As you descend through the levels, you upgrade your wands and become stronger to face the various bosses and enemies you encounter.</h4>
        
        <h5> Baldur's Gate 3 is a turn-based RPG based on one of D&D's rulesets. Each player's adventure will differ thanks to the openess the game offers allowing players to find their own solutions to situations whether that be through dialogue, action, or discovering the results of ignoring certain plot points altogther.</h5>

        <h6> Exanima is a 3D isometric RPG with a physics based combat system. You explore a huge dungeon while interacting with the different creatures and finding new gear. The game is still early access/incomplete, but as long as players are looking for an interesting game to try out and don't mind potentially encountering more bugs and glitches than normal, Exanima is definitely worth checking out. </h6>

        <h6> Insurgency: Sandstorm is a sequel to the first indie game, Insurgency. Like the first game, Sandstorm is very much team based and requires tactical play. Players can choose to play either competitively, or play the coop game modes, which receives new challenges every few weeks. For example, one of the challenges made bots drop grenades at death, which could cause all kinds of chaos if your team is uncoordinated and isn't calling out their kills. </h6>
